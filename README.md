This is Luke Linigari's Summer 2022 intern project

## Overview

*Springfield BC is on the brink of a digital transformation. It was picked by the Canadian government to be a pioneer of smart city evolution… One of the first initiatives is the development of a citywide electric autonomous car-share system. The city will ban car ownership and mandate the use of car sharing for all personal journeys."*
